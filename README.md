# Neobis_iOS_LoginApp

## Description 

This is the first project in Neobis Club. Our mission was to make the app according to the design and adapt to any screen size by using auto-layout. The project consist of UIElements, such as UILabel, UITextfield and UIButton.

## Getting started 

- Make sure you have the XCode version 14.0 or above installed on your computer
- Download the project files from the repository
- Open the project files in Xcode
- Run the active scheme by using any emulator (No install requirements for this project)

## Usage

By clicking button "Sign In", your login and password will display on the terminal. 

## Running the Tests

First of all, I tested auto-layout functionality by running different versions of apps. And each of them we have all components from design and they placed on right place.
Next I tested the function, that writes login and password on the terminal. Works correctly on nil, empty string and other.
